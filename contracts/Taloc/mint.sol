    //Here is an example of a Solidity function that mints a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) when triggered by an event:
    //This contract defines an NFT with three properties: id, name, and image. The mint function takes three arguments: _id, _name, and _image, which represent the properties of the NFT to be minted. The function assigns the input values to the properties of the NFT, and then emits the Mint event.

    pragma solidity ^0.8.3;
    contract MyNFTMinter {
    // Define the NFT's properties
    uint256 id;
    string name;
    string image;

    // Event for minting NFTs
    event Mint(uint256 indexed _id, string _name, string _image);

    // Function to mint a new NFT
    function mint(uint256 _id, string memory _name, string memory _image) public {
        require(_id > 0);
        id = _id;
        name = _name;
        image = _image;

        // Emit the Mint event
        emit Mint(id, name, image);
    }

    //You can trigger this function by calling it from another contract or by using a web3 client. In order to mint the NFT you need to pass the id, name, and image to the mint function,

    myNFTMinter.mint(1, "My first NFT", "https://example.com/image1.jpg")

    //This function mints an NFT with an id of 1, a name of "My first NFT", and an image URL of "https://example.com/image1.jpg".
    //Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and you may need to add more functionality like ownership, transfer, and access control to the contract to make it fully functional.

//////Here is an example of a Solidity function that fractionalizes an NFT upon mint: (FYI this is for an example where the fractional value is all the same ex: we break 1 NFT into a total supply of 1,000. each owner will have equal share)
//This contract defines an NFT with four properties: id, name, image and totalSupply. The mint function takes four arguments: _id, _name, _image, and _totalSupply, which represent the properties of the NFT to be minted. The function assigns the input values to the properties of the NFT and defines a mapping balanceOf that keeps track of how many fractionalized tokens each address owns. The balance of the msg.sender is set to the total supply, and the msg.sender is set as the owner.

        owner = msg.sender;
        // Emit the Mint event
        emit Mint(msg.sender, id, name, image, totalSupply);
    }
    // Function to transfer ownership
    function transfer(address _to) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);

    }
    // Function to check the balance of an address
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balanceOf[_owner];
    }

    //You can trigger this function by calling it from another contract or by using a web3 client. In order to mint the NFT you need to pass the id, name, image, and totalSupply to the mint function,

    myNFTMinter.mint(1, "My first NFT", "https://example.com/image1.jpg", 1000)
    //This function mints an NFT with an id of 1, a name of "My first NFT", an image URL of "https://example.com/image1.jpg", and a totalSupply of 1000. The msg.sender will have a balance of 1000.

    //You can also transfer the ownership of the NFT to another address using the transfer function,
    myNFTMinter.transfer(address)

///////Here is an example of a Solidity function that fractionalizes an NFT with different values upon mint: (FYI this seems to assign different values to the fractionalized tokens, but the are fixed, would need them dynamic)
